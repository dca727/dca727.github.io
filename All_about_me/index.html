    <p>Hi my name is Donnie Ca. I am a Junior in Lawndale High.</p>
    <p>My hobbies consists of basketball, playing video games, and relaxing at home doing nothing. One of the places that I like to go is at the beach.
    The place that I would love to travel to is anywhere in
    Europe and Vietnam, because I never been to any of those places. I want to get the experience in going into another country.</p>
    <p>The colleges that I am planning into applying is all of the UC schools. Specifically UC San Diego, UCLA, or UC Berkeley. I want to be a doctor in the future. However, it will not be an easy task.</p>
